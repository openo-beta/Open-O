## Technical Notes

1. **Naming Convention**: All action classes use the `*2Action` suffix, suggesting a migration from an earlier Struts version
2. **Package Structure**: Actions are organized by functional module under `org.oscarehr.*` and `oscar.*` packages
3. **Result Mappings**: Most actions define multiple result mappings for different outcomes (success, failure, error, etc.)
4. **JSP Integration**: Actions primarily forward to JSP pages for view rendering

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Orphaned Actions**: 18 additional orphaned actions remain that could be cleaned up
2. **Module Consolidation**: Consider consolidating overlapping report modules (oscarReport vs report)
3. **Naming Standardization**: Consider migrating from `oscar.*` to `org.oscarehr.*` package structure
4. **Documentation**: Add inline comments in struts.xml to document complex action workflows
