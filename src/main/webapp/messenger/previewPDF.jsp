/**
 * PDF Preview Renderer
 *
 * This minimal JSP page renders HTML content as PDF for message attachment previews.
 * It takes HTML source text from a form parameter and uses the Doc2PDF utility to
 * generate and stream a PDF response directly to the client browser.
 *
 * Main Features:
 * - Direct HTML to PDF conversion using Doc2PDF utility
 * - Minimal processing with security validation
 * - Streams PDF content directly to response output
 *
 * Security Requirements:
 * - Requires "_msg" object read permissions via security taglib
 * - User session validation and role-based access control
 *
 * Request Parameters:
 * - srcText: Required HTML source content to convert to PDF
 *
 * Processing:
 * 1. Validates user permissions
 * 2. Extracts HTML content from srcText parameter
 * 3. Wraps content in basic HTML structure
 * 4. Uses Doc2PDF.parseString2PDF() to generate and stream PDF
 *
 * @since 2003
