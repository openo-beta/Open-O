/**
 * Transfer Completion Confirmation Page
 *
 * This JSP page displays a confirmation message after document transfer has been
 * completed. It shows whether the attachment was successfully added to the target
 * demographic or if it was a duplicate attachment.
 *
 * Main Features:
 * - Displays completion status message with success/duplicate indication
 * - Provides close window functionality with parent window refresh
 * - Integration with OSCAR tab refresh system for message notifications
 * - Clean completion workflow for document transfer process
 *
 * Security Requirements:
 * - Requires "_msg" object write permissions via security taglib
 * - User session validation and role-based access control
 *
 * Request Attributes:
 * - confMessage: Status code indicating transfer result
 *   - "1": Duplicate attachment (already exists for demographic)
 *   - Other: Successful attachment (new attachment created)
 *
 * JavaScript Functions:
 * - BackToOscar(): Handles window closure and parent refresh
 *   - Calls parent window's refresh function for message notifications
 *   - Closes current window after brief delay
 *   - Fallback to simple window close if parent function not available
 *
 * User Experience:
 * - Clear success/duplicate messaging
 * - Automatic return to parent application
 * - Maintains workflow context through parent window integration
 *
 * Integration:
 * - Works with OSCAR tab alert system (oscar_new_msg)
 * - Called after PostItems.jsp processing completes
 * - Part of complete document transfer workflow
 *
 * @since 2003
