/**
 * Exception thrown when a client is restricted from accessing a service or program.
 *
 * This exception is thrown when a client attempts to access a program or service
 * from which they have an active restriction. Unlike other admission exceptions,
 * this one carries the actual ProgramClientRestriction object, providing detailed
 * information about the nature and scope of the restriction.
 *
 * Service restrictions are enforced for:
 * - Client safety (medical conditions, vulnerability)
 * - Staff safety (violence history, threats)
 * - Other client safety (predatory behavior, conflicts)
 * - Legal requirements (court orders, bail conditions)
 * - Administrative reasons (non-payment, documentation)
 * - Behavioral issues (property damage, substance use)
 *
 * Restriction characteristics:
 * - Can be facility-wide or program-specific
 * - May be temporary or permanent
 * - Can have conditions for lifting
 * - May require appeal process
 * - Often have review dates
 * - May allow exceptions for emergencies
 *
 * Common restriction scenarios:
 * - Banned from facility due to violence
 * - Restricted from overnight services
 * - Cannot access when intoxicated
 * - Barred pending investigation
 * - Restricted to specific programs only
 * - Limited to daytime services
 *
 * The included ProgramClientRestriction object contains:
 * - Client and program identifiers
 * - Restriction type and severity
 * - Start and end dates
 * - Reason for restriction
 * - Conditions for removal
 * - Review requirements
 * - Staff who applied restriction
 *
 * Handling recommendations:
 * - Display restriction details clearly
 * - Explain appeal process if available
 * - Suggest alternative services
 * - Document access attempt
 * - Notify appropriate staff
 * - Consider emergency overrides
 *
 * Legal and ethical considerations:
 * - Must balance safety with duty of care
 * - Restrictions must be proportionate
 * - Regular review required
 * - Appeal process must be available
 * - Cannot discriminate illegally
 * - Emergency services may override
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - Check restrictions before any service access
 * - Consider restriction inheritance (facility â†’ program)
 * - Account for restriction suspensions
 * - Validate restriction dates
 * - Log all restriction enforcements
