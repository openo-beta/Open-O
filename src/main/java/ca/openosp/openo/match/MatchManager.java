/**
 * Healthcare patient-provider match processing manager for OpenO EMR system.
 *
 * <p>This class serves as the primary implementation of the {@link IMatchManager} interface,
 * orchestrating the complete patient-provider matching workflow. It processes healthcare
 * events to automatically create, update, and maintain optimal patient-provider assignments
 * across multiple healthcare programs.</p>
 *
 * <p>Core Healthcare Processing Functions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>New patient registration - matches patients to available provider slots</li>
 *   <li>Provider vacancy creation - identifies suitable patients for new appointments</li>
 *   <li>Scheduled maintenance - optimizes existing matches and handles system cleanup</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Event-Driven Architecture: The system responds to healthcare workflow events
 * in real-time, ensuring that patient-provider matches are always current and
 * optimal. All match results are persisted to the database for healthcare
 * workflow management and reporting.</p>
 *
 * <p>Canadian Healthcare Integration: Designed to work within Canadian healthcare
 * delivery models including community health centers, family health teams,
 * and specialist referral networks.</p>
