/**
 * Represents a string-based condition value for exact text matching in clinical decision support guidelines.

 * DSValueString extends DSValue to support exact string equality comparisons.
 * This is used for matching categorical data such as gender, medication names,
 * diagnosis descriptions, and other text-based clinical information.
 * </p>

 * Unlike {@link DSValueStatement} which performs numeric comparisons,
 * DSValueString uses simple string equality matching. It is commonly used for:

 * <li>Medical code string matching (e.g., "icd9:250.0")</li>
 * <li>Text search in clinical notes (e.g., "'diabetes mellitus'")</li>
 * <li>Categorical value matching (e.g., "'active'", "'inactive'")</li>
