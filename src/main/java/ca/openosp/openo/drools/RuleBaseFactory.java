/**
 * Factory class for managing Drools RuleBase instances with caching.
 *
 * This factory provides centralized management of Drools rule bases used throughout
 * the OpenO EMR system for clinical decision support and business rule processing.
 * It implements a caching mechanism to optimize performance by avoiding repeated
 * compilation of rule bases.
 *
 * The factory uses a QueueCache to store rule base instances with automatic expiration
 * after 24 hours. This ensures that rule updates can be deployed without requiring
 * system restarts while maintaining good performance through caching.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Thread-safe singleton pattern for rule base management
 * - Automatic cache expiration after 24 hours
 * - Maximum of 2048 cached rule bases with a queue size of 4
 * - Support for multiple rule bases identified by unique source keys
 *
 * Common use cases in healthcare context:
 * - Clinical guideline enforcement (e.g., drug interaction checking)
 * - Chronic disease management protocols (diabetes, hypertension, CKD)
 * - Preventive care reminders and alerts
 * - Billing validation rules
 * - Quality improvement metrics calculation
 *
 * The source keys typically represent different rule sets such as:
 * - "prevention" for immunization and screening rules
 * - "ckd" for chronic kidney disease management
 * - "diabetes" for diabetes care guidelines
 * - "billing" for claims validation
 *
 * Thread Safety: All methods are synchronized to ensure thread-safe access
 * to the shared cache instance.
