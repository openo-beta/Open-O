/**
 * Utility class for Electronic Form Manager (EFM) patient form list operations.
 * This class was designed to provide functionality for managing patient-specific
 * electronic form lists, including form assignment, completion tracking, and
 * access control for clinical workflows.
 *
 * <p>Intended functionality includes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Patient-specific electronic form list management</li>
 *   <li>Form completion status tracking</li>
 *   <li>Clinical workflow integration for electronic forms</li>
 *   <li>Demographics-based form filtering and organization</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class currently serves as a foundation for future electronic form
 * management features in the OpenO EMR system. The DemographicDao dependency
 * indicates planned integration with patient demographic information for
 * form assignment and management workflows.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: This class is currently a placeholder with no implemented functionality.</p>
