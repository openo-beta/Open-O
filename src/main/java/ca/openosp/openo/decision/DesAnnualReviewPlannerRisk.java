/**
 * Orchestrates the generation of annual health review risk assessment forms.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as the main coordinator for processing clinical decision support
 * XML files and generating interactive HTML forms for risk factor identification and
 * documentation during annual health reviews. It utilizes SAX parsing to transform
 * XML-based clinical rules into user-friendly assessment forms for healthcare providers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Clinical Purpose:</strong> Systematic risk assessment is essential for
 * effective preventive healthcare delivery. This tool helps healthcare providers
 * systematically identify and document patient risk factors that may require
 * specific interventions, monitoring, or care modifications. The structured approach
 * ensures comprehensive risk evaluation and supports evidence-based clinical decisions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class provides two main functionalities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Generation of complete HTML risk assessment forms with interactive elements</li>
 * <li>Extraction of risk factor identifiers for use in subsequent checklist generation</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
